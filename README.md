# 📈 Stock Predictor

A machine learning model that predicts stock prices using a regression approach. This project achieves an **86% regression accuracy** within a **0.1 tolerance** using a deep learning architecture with:

- **ReLU** activation
- **Mean Squared Scaled (MSS)** loss function
- **Adam** optimizer

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts stock prices based on historical data
- Uses a regression model trained on time-series inputs
- High performance with 86% accuracy (tolerance ≤ 0.1)
- Modular and extensible codebase

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model Type:** Regression (Deep Learning)
- **Activation Function:** ReLU
- **Loss Function:** MSS (Mean Squared Scaled)
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy within 0.1 tolerance

---

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of historical stock prices. The dataset includes:
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Volume
- Optional: Technical indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI

> 📌 **Note:** Please ensure your data is normalized/scaled appropriately before training.
